The code folder has the various implementations that we wrote as part of the report.
- `Split_Regression.py`: this code is the implementation for performing the distributed regression described in section 3.2
- `penalization_accuracy.R`
- `D.TATE.12.10.NewEsts.R`


The report and presentation are also placed in the first level folder.
